# Boulder
A barebones, almost functional rhythm game/guitar tab viewer using Godot. Similar to rocksmith minus the functionality, design, and fun. 
Works with xml guitar tabs combined with corresponding sound files, but not very well. As of now, it only works with one song because of 
the inconsistent nature of custom charts in the form of xml files.
I also don't know how to make a proper README.md
